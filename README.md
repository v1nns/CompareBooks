# CompareBooks
A script to look for book prices made using Python :+1:

According to [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/what-kind-book-reader-are-you-diagnostics-guide/324062/), I'm a bookphile, so it's a little obvious that I have a passion in collecting books. Sadly, I had to sell my books in order to save some money (hard times :cry:), and that's why this script was created. It looks for book prices in a [local store site](https://www.saraiva.com.br/).

### Prerequisites

You will need to install:
- BeautifulSoup  

## **How to use** :fire:  
```
python checkbook.py path/file.txt
```
Inside the **file.txt**, insert the books names you wanna search for, each line represents a different book.
